The git commits contain each project submitted in course 210.
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - Project 2: Banking Application was a program built to calculate monthly deposits with user defined interest accumulation rate. This was solving an exigent need for the client needing an application to calculate balances after x years given a monthly deposit and anual interest.
- What did you do particularly well?
   - What I did well through this process is breakdown the project into manageable chunks that could be assigned to a method. For instance, the banking application robustness is particularly complex, however object-oriented programming supports code reuseability that is reflected here. The main method remained decluttered of driving code, but rather contained method calls to class-inherited methods. I did this part well as it makes debugging an easier task to accomplish by knowing where the main method ceased and which class-inherited method is problematic.
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
